Discuss a particular gapped RVB phase, namely the one which is realized on the triangular lattice (but also realized on square lattice). This phase admits four quasiparticles:

1. trivial excitation (e.g. spin wave)
2. spinons (spin1/2 fermions, mod 2)
3. Z2 vortices (spinless bosons, or called vison)
4. spinon-vison compisites

Anyonic particles are vest viewed as topological defects that reveal non-trivial properties of the ground state. An intuitive way to picture an anyon is to imagine a vortex in a medium with a local order parameter (see Fig. 1a). Of course, that is only a rough illustration. It resembles the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase with power-law correlation decay, while in anyonic systems correlations decay exponentially due to the energy gap.

Chargeless or spinless quasiparticles are generally hard to identity. Havent had an effective way to observe anyons. By virtue of their topological stability, they must have observable signature.
