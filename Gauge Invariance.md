Gauge Choice is basis choice. If I choose a gauge transformation and some quantity is invariant(e.g. translational/rotational invariant), then the system might be interesting: from one perspective, it means the system is constant in that gauge freedom(i.e. invariant under such gauge transformation). 

For example, the [[Berry phase]] is invariant under parallel-transport gauge.

Remember to ask yourself a question: under what gauge transformation the quantity (e.g. the Berry phase) is unchanged. [[qq_under what gauge is it unchanged]]
