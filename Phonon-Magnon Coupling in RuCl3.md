[[Topological Magnon_ A Review (2021)]]

1. **Learn how to use latex** to create notes efficiently. (Update the note once every one  
or two weeks)  

2. **Learn how to read papers when you know nothing about the background**. (We will  
continue the meeting once every two weeks)  

3. **Identify the important materials that you need to learn and find the materials that  
can help you learn the subject**. (You can ask me questions during the meeting.)  

4. Pave the way to **ask some research oriented questions**:  

(a) The magnon topological structure is less explored. What are t**he similarity/difference  
between the magnon topological bands** and how to calculate them?  

(b) **The effect of spin-orbit coupling?** Is it crucial? How? If so, what opportunity  
can strong spin-orbit coupled material provides?  

(c) Deeper question: every non-trivial quantum effects is rooted in **the complex  
phase of a many-body wave function.** Are there **intrinsic difference between the  
bosonic case(magnon) and fermionic case(electron)?** The physics can also be  
linked with the **Bose-Einstein condensate experiments** in the cold atom settings.  

(d) **Magnons usually lead to a problem related to non-Hermitian physics** because of  
the **structure of the generalized Bogoliubov transformation.** Section 3.1 of [1].  

(e) Whatâ€™s the inter place of nontrivial gapped topological magnon bands coupled  
to the gapless acoustic phonon? Especially in the RuCl3 material I will leave it to find out the im-  
portance of RuCl3. The margin note is useful for you to keep track of small questions you had  
during the project. *To use the latex template more efficiently, you can check NotesTeX*. **This material is a candidate for the Kitaev quantum spin liquid. However, the experiments are  
controversial.** One question is how to get the intermediate disorder state that is observed in the experiments. **The most recent experiment also find non-trivial data that is not easy to understand**. [2]
