 "Antiferromagnetism cannot be the ground state of any reasonable quantum system."

"In 1973, P. Anderson proposed that the ground state of a mechanical model n.n. Heisenberg model on a triangle lattice might be spin liquid." ^113823

An idealized system of quantum spin arranged in periodic lattice with short-range interaction describes the essential of a Mott insulating (i.e., interaction driven) material.

"The quantum spin liquid is the a qualitatively new kind of ground state."

Loosely speaking, different tyoes of quantum spin liquid correspond to different patterns of long-range entanglement, while a conventional state of magnetic matter has a short-range ectanglement. ^f8c291

Loosely speaking, spin liquid can be distinguished by whether the spectrum is gapped between the ground state and the excited states.

Gapped spin liquid is easier theoretically and well characterized by the global topological structure of ground state wave functions, which are said to have topological order. ^81b6be

Focus on fermion, mostly. Or the system with j=1/2.
