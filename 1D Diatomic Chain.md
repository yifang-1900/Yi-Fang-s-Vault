Since there are two atoms per unit cell, there are exactly two excitation mode per wavevector. Consider a 1D diatomic chain of two types of particles A and B which arrange like ABAB....AB. For each type of them, lattice constant $a$ is the same. If we take only the nearest neighbor interactions into account, we have two normal modes. Remeber that the system has translational symmetry, so the number of modes is only *two*. 

Construct the equation of motion. Plug in the plane wave solution (The amplitude of these two type of particles can be different.), we get the [linear algebra problem](https://youtu.be/zmOvH1b63A0)). Solve it, get two normal modes: optical phonon and acoustic phonon, which has neighboring two types of particles A and B act as a unit and act toward each other, respectively. Now we have the famous dispersion relation $\omega(k)$. The band width of optical mode is smaller. Imagine the square root of $[10-11]$ and $[0-1]$. ^133599

$a\sim10^{-10}$ for lattice,
so $P\sim\hbar k_{ph}\sim \sim 10^{-34}\cdot 10^{10}\sim 10^{-24}\ kg\cdot m/s$.
$\omega \sim vk_{ph} \sim 10^{3}\cdot 10^{10}$,
$E\sim\hbar \omega\sim \sim 10^{-34}\cdot 10^{13}\sim 10\ meV$.
Notice that for normal light, $\omega\sim 10^{13}$, $k \sim 10^{7} \ll k_{ph}$. 

Light can barely be absorbed by acoustic mode, while it can be absorbed by optocal mode.

Some relevant embodiment of phonon's properties is shown in [[Spaghetti Diagram]].
