Down: [[Kitaev Model]] [[RuCl3]] [[qq_lots of info about RuCl3 is here]]

Broholm et al. said in review summary that $\alpha - RuCl_{3}$ is thought to approximate to Kitaev model. 

In page 7, it says, "The proposal by Jackeli and Khaliullin (67) that certain Mott-Hubbard systems with partially filled t2g-levels and strong spin-orbit coupling might realize the Kitaev model led to an intense search."

In page 7, it mentions the disappear of magnetic order and the measurement of thermal Hall effect.
