[[Antiunitary Operator#^5aa9a8]] 

In fact, to satisfy the general weaker reuqirement $|\braket{\tilde{\beta}|\tilde{\alpha}}|=|\braket{\beta|\alpha}|$(compared tothe too restrictive one $\braket{\tilde{\beta}|\tilde{\alpha}}=\braket{\beta|\alpha}$)it is of physical interest to consider just two type of transformation: unitary and antiunitary. Other possibilities are related to either of the preceding via trivial phase changes. 

The proof of this assertion is actually very difficult and will not be discussed further here in Saurai's *Modern Quantum Mechanics*. See, however, Gottfried and Yan(2003), Section 7.1.
