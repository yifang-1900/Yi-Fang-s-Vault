This article reviews the current understanding of magnon band topology.

p2.
Haldane connect the idea of integer quantum Hall physics and band topology.

Band topology is rather common in both natural and artificially produced materials.

The idea of spin wave was first introduced by Felix Bloch in 1930 and afterwards other physicists calculated quantum spin wave.

"Now in the early 2020s, quantum magnetism is a mature field showing no signs of senescence. To the contrary, there is a tremendous amount of activity studying exotic magnetic phenomena especially with strong quantum fluctuations and spin-orbit coupling." ^d9928b*

*"In addition, the interplay of magnetic and crystalline symmetries has an important role in enriching band topology (Section 2.4) and magnetic materials offer a platform to study band topology in the presence of interactions."*(sec. 2.5) ^efd268

"One observation to make of Eq. 3 is that it generally does not conserve boson number. In this sense it bears some relation to mean field models of superconductivity." [[qq_Holstein-Primakoff Representation]]

*"The moments, of length S, are coupled through nearest neighbour ferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange and a second nearest neighbour DzyaloshinskiiMoriya interaction (DMI) with D vector perpendicular to the plane of the lattice (22). The latter coupling is allowed by symmetry because the midpoints of second neighbour bonds are not inversion symmetric. This, coupled to the fact that the DMI tends to appear to leading order in the spin-orbit coupling, makes this a fairly natural model of magnetism on the honeycomb lattice."* ^99caf5

The first observation of the magnon thermal Hall effect was in the insulating pyrochlore ferromagnet Lu2V2O7 (102) where it was attributed to the presence of a DMI.
